A <b>probability</b> is defined as a number which quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring.

Probabilities must be in the set 0 <= p <= 1, where p is a probability.

A probability of 0 for an event semantically means that the event has no chance of occurring.

Likewise, a probability of 1 for an event semantically means that the event is certain to occur.

All decimal values in between gauge the likelihood of the event, probabilities under 0.5 being less likely to occur, and over 0.5 being more likely to occur. 

Converting to percent form is simple as well:

1.0 = 100%
0.65 = 65%
0.873 = 87.3%
0.10 = 10%
0.50 = 50%
0.05 = 5%
